* cl-evdev: a Linux /dev/input driver for CL

=cl-evdev= is meant to be a drop-dead simple driver for teasing out events from
Linux's /dev/input drivers. It was originally designed for the Navi project, as
part of the silica keyboard handling routines.

Note: this code is by no means complete, and is less than alpha quality code.
I've tested it on SBCL and Ubuntu Linux 3.x as well as the embedded Linux kernel
built for Intel Edison boards, but nothing else.

** Usage

Use your typical ASDF system definition package, be it the old, deprecated ASDF,
or quicklisp.
